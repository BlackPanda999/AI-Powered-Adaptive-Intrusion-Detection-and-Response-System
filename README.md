## Introduction
The AI-Powered Adaptive Intrusion Detection and Response System (AI-ADRS) is a cutting-edge cybersecurity project that leverages artificial intelligence to protect networks from malicious activities. By integrating machine learning models (Random Forest and LSTM), real-time packet analysis with `scapy`, automated threat mitigation, cloud-based logging with AWS S3, and an interactive visualization dashboard using Plotly/Dash, AI-ADRS offers a robust, scalable, and future-ready solution. This repository contains the complete project, including code and detailed setup instructions, making it ideal for your team to deploy in academic, enterprise, or research environments.

## Project Objectives
- **Threat Detection**: Identify malicious network activities (e.g., DoS, probing, R2L, U2R attacks) using AI models trained on the NSL-KDD dataset.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Capture and analyze live network traffic using `scapy` for immediate threat detection.
- **Automated Response**: Block malicious IPs or trigger alerts to mitigate threats.
- **Cloud Integration**: Store threat logs in AWS S3 for persistent analysis and auditing.
- **Visualization**: Provide static (Matplotlib/Seaborn) and interactive (Plotly/Dash) visualizations to analyze threat patterns.

## Use Cases
- **Enterprise Security**: Monitor corporate networks and automate responses to minimize downtime.
- **Academic Research**: Study AI applications in cybersecurity with a real-world dataset and extensible code.
- **Portfolio Showcase**: Demonstrate expertise in AI, cybersecurity, and cloud technologies.
- **IoT Security**: Extend the system to protect IoT networks by analyzing device traffic patterns.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming**: Python 3.8+ with libraries: `scapy`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `boto3`, `plotly`, `dash`.
- **Dataset**: NSL-KDD, available at [UNB CIC](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html).
- **AI/ML**: Random Forest for robust classification; LSTM for sequential pattern detection.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib/Seaborn for static plots; Plotly/Dash for interactive web-based dashboards.
- **Cloud**: AWS S3 for secure threat logging.
